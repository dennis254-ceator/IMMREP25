TCR-pMHC Binding Prediction

Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict TCR-pMHC binding interactions. The model is trained on datasets from IEDB and VDJdb, using a Random Forest classifier. The sequences are encoded using ASCII-based transformations, and negative samples are generated by shuffling sequences.

Dataset

Train Data: IEDB and VDJdb positive binding samples.

Test Data: External test dataset for predictions.

Features Used

CDR3a, CDR3b, Peptide sequences encoded numerically.

Negative samples created by random permutation of sequences.

Model

Random Forest Classifier from sklearn.ensemble.

Evaluation metric: ROC-AUC score.

Train-test split: 80%-20% stratified split.

Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib

Usage

Prepare the Data: Ensure CSV files are in the correct directory.

Run the Notebook: Execute the notebook to train the model.

Make Predictions: The trained model will generate a submission.csv file with predictions.

Output

Validation AUC Score is printed after training.

Predictions are saved in submission.csv.
